# A simple python bib-to-docx parser

Like the title says:   
takes a bib-tex bibliography file as input, and outputs a formatted docx file.

bib_to_docx.py will take 'bib_in.bib' and produce the 'bib_out.docx'.

Haven't packaged into a class, feel free to play with formatting.

This is very elementary still, just an opportunity for me to explore regex and play with the docx package.

P.S.: the bib file here was exported from the Web of Knowledge website.
