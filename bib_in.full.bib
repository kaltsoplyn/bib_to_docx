Abstract = {{In this work we demonstrate the use of neural networks for rapid
   extraction of signal parameters of discretely sampled signals. In
   particular, we use dense autoencoder networks to extract the parameters
   of interest from exponentially decaying signals and decaying
   oscillations. By using a three-stage training method and careful choice
   of the neural network size, we are able to retrieve the relevant signal
   parameters directly from the latent space of the autoencoder network at
   significantly improved rates compared to traditional algorithmic
   signal-analysis approaches. We show that the achievable precision and
   accuracy of this method of analysis is similar to conventional
   algorithm-based signal analysis methods, by demonstrating that the
   extracted signal parameters are approaching their fundamental parameter
   estimation limit as provided by the Cramer-Rao bound. Furthermore, we
   demonstrate that autoencoder networks are able to achieve signal
   analysis, and, hence, parameter extraction, at rates of 75 kHz,
   orders-of-magnitude faster than conventional techniques with similar
   precision. Finally, our exploration of the limitations of our approach
   in different computational systems suggests that analysis rates of >200
   kHz are feasible using neural networks in systems where the transfer
   time between the data-acquisition system and data-analysis modules can
   be kept below similar to 3 mu s.}},

Abstract = {{We present precise optical rotation measurements of gaseous chiral
   samples using near-IR continuous-wave cavity-enhanced polarimetry.
   Optical rotation is determined by comparing cavity ring-down signals for
   two counter-propagating beams of orthogonal polarisation which are
   subject to polarisation rotation by the presence of both an optically
   active sample and a magneto-optic crystal. A broadband RF noise source
   applied to the laser drive current is used to tune the laser linewidth
   and optimise the polarimeter, and this noise-induced laser linewidth is
   quantified using self-heterodyne beat-note detection. We demonstrate the
   optical rotation measurement of gas phase samples of enantiomers of
   alpha-pinene and limonene with an optimum detection precision of 10 mu
   deg per cavity pass and an uncertainty in the specific rotation of
   similar to 0.1 deg dm(-1) (g/ml)(-1) and determine the specific rotation
   parameters at 730 nm, for (+)- and (-)-alpha-pinene to be 32.10 +/- 0.13
   and -32.21 +/- 0.11 deg dm(-1) (g/ml)(-1), respectively. Measurements of
   both a pure R-(+)-limonene sample and a non-racemic mixture of limonene
   of unknown enantiomeric excess are also presented, illustrating the
   utility of the technique. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the

Abstract = {{The inherent weak nature of chiroptical signals provided by typical
   polarimetric measurements of natural optically active media has led to
   the development of different techniques to achieve enhanced chiral
   sensing. Intuitively, the introduction of gain could provide the desired
   enhancement; however, this requires gain media that can couple directly
   to the chiral medium. Here, it is shown that nanophotonic systems that
   generate collinear electric and magnetic dipole moments can mediate the
   coupling between the gain and chiral medium, leading to signals stronger
   than those achieved by the chiral medium alone or when combined with the
   same nanophotonic system without gain. Depending on how strongly gain
   couples with the nanophotonic system, both background amplification and
   loss compensation are possible. In this context, it also is shown that
   the enhancement occurs within the regime of loss compensation, because
   background amplification may also result in amplified transmitted
   fields, but does not guarantee the enhancement of chiroptical signals.

Abstract = {{The characterization of metamaterials typically depends on the
   determination of scattering parameters like transmittance and
   reflectance, and comparison with numerical models. While, numerically,
   coherent plane wave scattering amplitudes for infinite perfectly
   periodic samples are readily accessible, experimental measurements
   necessarily involve scattering of possibly incoherent optical probes
   with finite-size illumination spots on finite sample surfaces that need
   to serve as a proxy for the true plane wave scattering amplitudes. In
   some situations, but not always, this difference can lead to
   substantially different observed scattering spectra. Here, we
   investigate and analyze the observable effects on the measured
   scattering spectra originating from coherent versus incoherent optical
   probes, finite illumination spot size, magnifying imaging systems, as
   well as beam shaping optical elements. We discuss the relation of all
   the above to the wave vector content of the illumination and the
   sample's spatial dispersion properties, and we show that they can result
   in qualitatively significant deviations of observed scattering spectra
   from true plane wave scattering, which needs to be taken into account to
   really understand experiments and allow a faithful comparison with
   simulations.}},

Month = {{MAY 31}},
Abstract = {{Biosensors are indispensable tools for public, global, and personalized
   healthcare as they provide tests that can be used from early disease
   detection and treatment monitoring to preventing pandemics. We introduce
   single-wavelength imaging biosensors capable of reconstructing spectral
   shift information induced by biomarkers dynamically using an advanced
   data processing technique based on an optimal linear estimator. Our
   method achieves superior sensitivity without wavelength scanning or
   spectroscopy instruments. We engineered diatomic dielectric metasurfaces
   supporting bound states in the continuum that allows high-quality
   resonances with accessible near-fields by in-plane symmetry breaking.
   The large-area metasurface chips are configured as microarrays and
   integrated with microfluidics on an imaging platform for real-time
   detection of breast cancer extracellular vesicles encompassing exosomes.
   The optofluidic system has high sensing performance with nearly 70 1/RIU
   figure-of-merit enabling detection of on average 0.41 nanoparticle/mu
   m(2) and real-time measurements of extracellular vesicles binding from
   down to 204 femtomolar solutions. Our biosensors provide the robustness
   of spectrometric approaches while substituting complex instrumentation
   with a single-wavelength light source and a
   complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor camera, paving the way toward
   miniaturized devices for point-of-care diagnostics. The authors engineer
   a type of bound states in the continuum in diatomic dielectric
   metasurfaces, allowing for high-quality resonances with accessible
   enhanced fields. Metasurface microarrays are integrated with
   microfluidics on an imaging platform for real-time detection of

Abstract = {{The tropical forests are Earth's largest source of biogenic volatile
   organic compounds (BVOCs) and thus also the largest atmospheric sink
   region for the hydroxyl radical (OH). However, the OH sink above
   tropical forests is poorly understood, as past studies have revealed
   large unattributed fractions of total OH reactivity. We present the
   first total OH reactivity and volatile organic compound (VOC)
   measurements made at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) at 80,
   150, and 320 m above ground level, covering two dry seasons, one wet
   season, and one transition season in 2018-2019. By considering a wide
   range of previously unaccounted for VOCs, which we identified by proton
   transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS), the
   unattributed fraction was with an overall average of 19\% within the
   measurement uncertainty of similar to 35 \%. In terms of seasonal
   average OH reactivity, isoprene accounted for 23 \%-43\% of the total
   and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) for 22 \%-40 \%, while monoterpenes,
   sesquiterpenes, and green leaf volatiles combined were responsible for 9
   \%-14 \%. These findings show that OVOCs were until now an
   underestimated contributor to the OH sink above the Amazon forest.
   By day, total OH reactivity decreased towards higher altitudes with
   strongest vertical gradients observed around noon during the dry season
   (-0.026 s(-1) m(-1)), while the gradient was inverted at night. Seasonal
   differences in total OH reactivity were observed, with the lowest
   daytime average and standard deviation of 19.9 +/- 6.2 s(-1) during a
   wet-dry transition season with frequent precipitation; 23.7 +/- 6.5
   s(-1) during the wet season; and the highest average OH reactivities
   during two dry-season observation periods with 28.1 +/- 7.9 s(-1) and
   29.1 +/- 10.8 s(-1), respectively. The effects of different
   environmental parameters on the OH sink were investigated, and
   quantified, where possible. Precipitation caused short-term spikes in
   total OH reactivity, which were followed by below-normal OH reactivity
   for several hours. Biomass burning increased total OH reactivity by 2.7
   to 9.5 s(-1). We present a temperature-dependent parameterization of OH
   reactivity that could be applied in future models of the OH sink to
   further reduce our knowledge gaps in tropical-forest OH chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Precise optical rotation measurements play an important role in the
   analysis of chiral molecules in various fields, especially in biological
   chemistry and pharmacology. In this paper, we demonstrate a new variant
   of continuous-wave cavity-enhanced polarimetry for detecting the optical
   activity of two enantiomers of a chiral molecule at 730 nm. It is based
   on a signal-reversing technique for which the chiral specific rotation
   is directly determined by the cavity ring-down signal from two
   counter-propagating beams in a bow-tie cavity. In particular, we ensure
   reproducible excitation of both modes by broadening the linewidth of a
   diode laser source by application of a radio frequency perturbation to
   its injection current. The performance of the polarimeter is
   demonstrated for the specific rotation of (+)- and (-)-alpha-pinene in
   different environments, including the pure vapor, open air, and the
   liquid phase; the detection precision ranges between 10(-5) and 10(-4)
   degrees per cavity pass depending on the environment. The apparatus is a
   robust and practical tool for quantifying chirality and can be developed
   for the entire visible and near-infrared spectral regions.}},

Abstract = {{We present different computational approaches for the rapid extraction
   of the signal parameters of discretely sampled damped sinusoidal
   signals. We compare time- and frequency-domain-based computational
   approaches in terms of their accuracy and precision and computational
   time required in estimating the frequencies of such signals, and observe
   a general trade-off between precision and speed. Our motivation is
   precise and rapid analysis of damped sinusoidal signals as these become
   relevant in view of the recent experimental developments in
   cavity-enhanced polarimetry and ellipsometry, where the relevant time
   scales and frequencies are typically within the similar to 1 - 10 mu s
   and similar to 1 - 100 MHz ranges, respectively. In such experimental
   efforts, single-shot analysis with high accuracy and precision becomes
   important when developing experiments that study dynamical effects
   and/or when developing portable instrumentations. Our results suggest
   that online, running-fashion, microsecond-resolved analysis of
   polarimetric/ellipsometric measurements with fractional uncertainties at
   the 10(-6) levels, is possible, and using a proof-of-principle
   experimental demonstration we show that using a frequency-based analysis
   approach we can monitor and analyze signals at kHz rates and accurately
   detect signal changes at microsecond time-scales. Published by The

Abstract = {{Dielectric metasurfaces have emerged as a powerful platform for novel
   optical biosensors. Due to their low optical loss and strong
   light-matter interaction, they demonstrate several exotic optical
   properties, including sharp resonances, strong nearfield enhancements,
   and the compelling capability to support magnetic modes. They also show
   advantages such as CMOS-compatible fabrication processes and lower
   resonance-induced heating compared to their plasmonic counterparts.
   These unique characteristics are enabling the advancement of
   cutting-edge sensing techniques for new applications. In this
   Perspective, we review the recent progress of dielectric metasurface
   sensors. First, the working mechanisms and properties of dielectric
   metasurfaces are briefly introduced by highlighting several
   state-of-the-art examples. Next, we describe the application of
   dielectric metasurfaces for label-free sensing in three different
   detection schemes, namely, refractometric sensing, surface-enhanced
   spectroscopy through Raman scattering and infrared absorption, and
   chiral sensing. Finally, we provide a perspective for the future
   directions of this exciting research field.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral sensitive techniques have been used to probe the fundamental
   symmetries of the universe, study biomolecular structures, and even
   develop safe drugs. The traditional method for the measurement of
   chirality is through optical activity, however, chiroptical signals are
   inherently weak and often suppressed by large backgrounds. Different
   techniques have been proposed to overcome the limitations of
   traditionally used optical polarimetry, such as cavity- and/or
   nanophotonic-based schemes. In this chapter we demonstrate how surface
   plasmon resonance can be employed as a new research tool for chiral
   sensing, which we term here as CHIral Surface Plasmon Resonance
   (CHISPR). We present how surface plasmons at a metal-chiral interface
   are sensitive to the chirality parameter of the chiral medium and how
   their properties can be exploited to reveal information not easily
   accessible using standard polarimetric/nanophotonic approaches. We then
   present an experimental realisation of CHISPR, an angle-resolved
   measurement scheme, and demonstrate how can one detect the complete
   chirality (handedness and magnitude) of a chiral sample while being also
   sensitive to both the real and imaginary part of a chiral sample's
   refractive index. We present analytical results and numerical
   simulations of CHISPR measurements, predicting signals in the mdeg range
   for chiral samples of <100 nm thickness at visible wavelengths. Finally,
   we present a theoretical analysis that clarifies the underlying physics
   of the near-field chiral interactions and their far-field manifestation.
   In overall, CHISPR builds upon the strengths of standard SPR: does not
   require elaborate fabrication and has the advantage of being directly
   implementable on existing SPR instrumentation, making it, thus, an ideal
   modality for studying chirality dynamics on surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Cannabinoids have been shown to protect the retina from
   ischemic/excitotoxic insults. The aim of the present study was to
   investigate the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of the
   synthetic cannabinoid (R)-WIN55,212-2 (CB1/CB2 receptor agonist) when
   administered acutely or subchronically in control and AMPA treated
   retinas. Sprague-Dawley rats were intravitreally administered (acutely)
   with vehicle or AMPA, in the absence or presence of (R)-WIN55,212-2
   (10(-7) -10(-4) M) alone or in combination with AM251 {[}CB1 receptor
   antagonist/inverse agonist,10(-4) M] and AM630 (CB2 receptor
   antagonist,10(-4) M). In addition, AMPA was coadministered with the
   racemic (R,S)-WIN55,212 (10(-4) M). (R)-WIN55,212-2 was also
   administered subchronically (25,100 mu g/kg,i.p.,4d) in control and AMPA
   treated rats. Immunohistochemical studies were performed using
   antibodies against the CB1R, and retinal markers for retinal neurons
   (brain nitric oxide synthetase, bNOS) and microglia (ionized calcium
   binding adaptor molecule 1, Iba1). ELISA assay was employed to assess
   TNFa levels in AMPA treated retinas. Intravitreal administration of
   (R)-WIN55,212-2 reversed the AMPA induced loss of bNOS expressing
   amacrine cells, an effect that was blocked by both AM251 and AM630.
   (R,S)WIN55,212 had no effect. (R)-WIN55,212-2 also reduced a) the AMPA
   induced activation of microglia, by activating CB2 receptors that were
   shown to be colocalized with Ibal + reactive microglial cells, and b)
   TNF alpha levels in retina. (R)-WIN55,212-2 administered subchronically
   led to the downregulation of CB1 receptors at the high dose of 100 mu
   g/kg(i.p.), and to the attenuation of the WIN55,212-2 induced
   neuroprotection of amacrine cells. At the same dose, (R)-WIN55,212-2 did
   not attenuate the AMPA induced increase in the number of reactive
   microglia cells, suggesting CB2 receptor downregulation under subchronic
   conditions. This study provides new findings regarding the role of CB1
   and CB2 receptor activation by the synthetic cannabinoid
   (R)-WIN55,212-2, administered acutely or sub-chronically, on neuron
   viability and microglia activation in healthy and diseased retina.}},

Abstract = {{A split-cube-resonator-based metamaterial structure that can act as a
   polarization- and direction-selective perfect absorber for the infrared
   region is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated. The structure,
   fabricated by direct laser writing and electroless silver plating, is
   comprised of four layers of conductively-coupled split-cube magnetic
   resonators, appropriately rotated to each other to bestow the desired
   electromagnetic properties. We show narrowband polarization-selective
   perfect absorption when the structure is illuminated from one side; the
   situation is reversed when illuminating from the other side, with the
   orthogonal linear polarization being absorbed. The absorption peak can
   be tuned in a wide frequency range by a sparser or denser arrangement of
   the split cube resonators, allowing to cover the entire atmospheric
   transparency window. The proposed metamaterial structure can find
   applications in polarization-selective thermal emission at the IR
   atmospheric transparency window for radiative cooling, in cost-effective
   infrared sensing devices, and in narrowband filters and linear
   polarizers in reflection mode.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Many bird species have the ability to navigate home after being brought
   to a remote, even unfamiliar location. Environmental odours have been
   demonstrated to be critical to homeward navigation in over 40 years of
   experiments, yet the chemical identity of the odours has remained
   unknown. In this study, we investigate potential chemical navigational
   cues by measuring volatile organic compounds (VOCs): at the birds'
   home-loft; in selected regional forest environments; and from an
   aircraft at 180 m. The measurements showed clear regional, horizontal
   and vertical spatial gradients that can form the basis of an olfactory
   map for marine emissions (dimethyl sulphide, DMS), biogenic compounds
   (terpenoids) and anthropogenic mixed air (aromatic compounds), and
   temporal changes consistent with a sea-breeze system. Air masses
   trajectories are used to examine GPS tracks from released birds,
   suggesting that local DMS concentrations alter their flight directions
   in predictable ways. This dataset reveals multiple regional-scale
   real-world chemical gradients that can form the basis of an olfactory
   map suitable for homing pigeons.}},

   activity against the bee parasite Varroa destructor}},
Journal = {{ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{One major disease of the pupae and the adult bee is the so-called
   Varroosis that is owing to the bee parasite Varroa destructor. It is an
   ectoparasite of bees, causing significant losses in the bee population
   needed for honey production as well as for pollination in agriculture.
   Costic acid is a sesquiterpene-carboxylic acid present in the plant
   Dittrichia viscosa. Recent studies by our group have shown that costic
   acid acts as acaricide against V. destructor. Oxalic acid is also an
   acaricide commonly used against varroa mites. In spite of its structural
   simplicity-it is the simplest bicarboxlic acid-it is equipotent to
   costic acid which consists of a trans-decalin system with three chiral
   centres. The basic goal of this project was to design and synthesize a
   hybrid entity, incorporating aspects of both oxalic acid and costic acid
   that would be more active than the parent compounds. This approach
   introduces a useful strategy for the preparation of congeners of
   bioactive compounds and proposes a structural framework for a new series
   of acaricidal agents.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{Metasurfaces, the two-dimensional analogs of metamaterials, are ideal
   platforms for sensing molecular chirality at the nanoscale, e.g., of
   inclusions of natural optically active molecules, as they offer large
   accessible surfaces and can provide the necessary strong resonances for
   coupling the probing radiation with the chiral inclusions. Here, by
   employing a less familiar but more convenient formalism, we examine
   chiral inclusions in achiral isotropic metasurfaces; the latter sustain
   the electric and magnetic resonant dipoles to enhance the chirality
   features. We derive analytically, and verify numerically, expressions
   that provide insight to the enhancement mechanism of the magnetoelectric
   coupling and explain why circular dichroism signals (difference in
   absorption between left and right circularly polarized waves) can arise
   from both the real and the imaginary part of the chirality parameter
   kappa, correcting thus existing misconceptions. Our analysis
   demonstrates distinct chiroptical signals where the contributions from
   both the real and imaginary part of kappa can be independently observed
   and, based on such measurements, we propose a scheme for the unambiguous
   determination of an unknown chirality.}},

Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS EARTH \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{1}},

Month = {{AUG 13}},
Abstract = {{Many biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) are chiral, existing in
   two mirror image forms called enantiomers. The most abundant atmospheric
   chiral BVOC is alpha -pinene (C10H16), whose enantiomeric ratio has been
   reported to be regiospecific. Here we show with measurements made on a
   325m tower in the Amazon rainforest that the enantiomeric ratio varies
   unexpectedly (by a factor of ten) with (+)-alpha -pinene dominating at
   canopy level and (-)-alpha -pinene at tower top. The ratio is
   independent of wind direction, speed and sunlight but shows diurnal
   temperature dependent enrichment in the (-)-alpha -pinene enantiomer at
   the lowest 80m height. These effects cannot be caused by atmospheric
   reaction with oxidants(,) or aerosol uptake. The reversal of chiral
   ratio at 80m reveals the presence of a potent uncharacterized local
   (+)-alpha -pinene rich source, possibly linked to herbivory and
   termites. These results suggest the presence of a strong uncharacterized
   BVOC source that is overlooked in current emission models. The chiral
   compositions of biogenic volatile organic compounds over the Amazon
   tropical rainforest vary with height, time of day and season, according
   to measurements from a 325m tall tower.}},

Abstract = {{Sensing molecular chirality at the nanoscale has been a long-standing
   challenge due to the inherently weak nature of chiroptical signals, and
   nanophotonic approaches have proven fruitful in accessing these signals.
   However, in most cases, complete sensing of the chiral part of the
   molecule's refractive index (magnitude and sign of both its real and
   imaginary part) has not been possible, while the strong inherent signals
   from the nanostructures themselves obscure the weak chiroptical signals.
   Here, we propose a dielectric metamaterial system that overcomes these
   limitations and allows for complete measurements of the total chirality
   and discrimination of the effects of its real and imaginary part,
   possible also in an absolute manner via the application of a crucial
   signal reversal (excitation with reversed polarization that enables
   chirality measurements without the need for sample removal. As proof of
   principle, we demonstrate signal enhancements by a factor of 200 for
   ultrathin, subwavelength, chiral samples over a uniform and accessible
   area.}},

Abstract = {{We present a compact polarimeter, which can perform sensitive
   measurements of optical rotation in vapor. The operation of the
   polarimeter is based on a Cavity Ring-Down scheme which employs two
   signal reversals, which increase sensitivity and reduce noise, allowing
   the realization of sensitive measurements in the presence of spurious
   birefringence. We describe the operation of the polarimeter, give the
   basic equations for the signal analysis and retrieval of optical
   rotation angle, and present measurements that demonstrate a sensitivity
   of similar to 80 mu deg/pass.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the influence of chirality on the PT-symmetric and
   PT-broken phase of PT-symmetric chiral systems. Starting from the point
   that transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) waves have
   different exceptional points, we show that with circularly polarized
   waves (which are linear combinations of TM and TE waves) mixed
   PT-symmetric phases can be realized and the extent of these phases can
   be highly controlled by either or both the chirality and the angle of
   incidence. Additionally, while the transmission of both TM and TE waves
   in nonchiral PT-symmetric systems is the same for forward and backward
   propagation, we show that with chirality this symmetry can be broken. As
   a result, it is possible to realize asymmetric, i.e., side-dependent,
   rotation, and ellipticity in the polarization state of the transmitted
   wave. Our results constitute a simple example of a chiral PT-symmetric
   optical system in which the various phases (full PT, mixed, broken) and
   the asymmetric effects can be easily tuned by adjusting the chirality
   parameter and/or the angle of incidence.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of gain and loss in optical systems that respect
   parity-time (PT)-symmetry has pointed recently to a variety of novel
   optical phenomena and possibilities. Many of them can be realized by
   combining the PT-symmetry concepts with metamaterials. Here we
   investigate the case of chiral metamaterials, showing that combination
   of chiral metamaterials with PT-symmetric gain-loss enables a very rich
   variety of phenomena and functionalities. Examining a simple
   one-dimensional chiral PT-symmetric system, we show that, with normally
   incident waves, the PT-symmetric and the chirality-related
   characteristics can be tuned independently and superimposed almost at
   will. On the other hand, under oblique incidence, chirality affects all
   the PT-related characteristics, leading also to novel and uncommon wave
   propagation features, such as asymmetric transmission and asymmetric
   optical activity and ellipticity. All these features are highly
   controllable both by chirality and by the angle of incidence, making
   PT-symmetric chiral metamaterials valuable in a large range of
   polarization-control-targeting applications.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new cavity-based polarimetric scheme for highly sensitive
   and time-resolved measurements of birefringence and dichroism, linear
   and circular, that employs rapidly pulsed single-frequency continuous
   wave (CW) laser sources and extends current cavity-based
   spectropolarimetric techniques. We demonstrate how the use of a CW laser
   source allows for gains in spectral resolution, signal intensity, and
   data acquisition rate compared to traditional pulsed-based cavity
   ring-down polarimetry (CRDP). We discuss a particular CW-CRDP modality
   that is different from intensity-based cavity-enhanced polarimetric
   schemes as it relies on the determination of the polarization rotation
   frequency during a ring-down event generated by large intracavity
   polarization anisotropies. We present the principles of CW-CRDP and
   validate the applicability of this technique for the measurement of the
   non-resonant Faraday effect in solid SiO2 and CeF3 and gaseous butane.
   We give a general analysis of the fundamental sensitivity limits for
   CRDP techniques and show how the presented frequency-based methodology
   alleviates the requirement for high finesse cavities to achieve high
   polarimetric sensitivities and, thus, allows for the extension of
   cavity-based polarimetric schemes into different spectral regimes, but
   most importantly renders the CW-CRDP methodology particularly suitable
   for robust portable polarimetric instrumentations.}},

Abstract = {{Probing individual chemical reactions is key to mapping reaction
   pathways. Trace analysis of sub-kDa reactants and products is obfuscated
   by labels, however, as reaction kinetics are inevitably perturbed. The
   thiol-disulfide exchange reaction is of specific interest as it has many
   applications in nanotechnology and in nature. Redox cycling of single
   thiols and disulfides has been unresolvable due to a number of
   technological limitations, such as an inability to discriminate the
   leaving group. Here, we demonstrate detection of single-molecule
   thiol-disulfide exchange using a label-free optoplasmonic sensor. We
   quantify repeated reactions between sub-kDa thiolated species in real
   time and at concentrations down to 100's of attomolar. A unique sensing
   modality is featured in our measurements, enabling the observation of
   single disulfide reaction kinetics and pathways on a plasmonic
   nanoparticle surface. Our technique paves the way towards characterising
   molecules in terms of their charge, oxidation state, and chirality via
   optoplasmonics. Visualising single-molecule reactions, to understand
   their mechanisms, is a challenging task. Here, the authors investigate
   disulfide exchange reactions with thiolates immobilised on a gold
   nanoparticle through a label-free optoplasmonic sensor, and detect
   individual disulfide interactions in solution}},

   between whispering-gallery modes in a germanate
   (56GeO(2)-31PbO-9Na(2)O-4Ga(2)O(3)) microspherical cavity due to the
   Faraday effect. An encapsulated gold conductor heats the resonator and
   tunes the quasi-transverse electric (TE) and quasi-transverse magnetic
   (TM) polarized modes with an efficiency of similar to 65fm/V at a
   peak-to-peak bias voltage of 4V. The signal parameters for a number of
   heating regimes are quantified to confirm sensitivity to the generated
   magnetic field. The quasi-TE and quasi-TM resonance frequencies stably
   converge near the device's heating rate limit (equivalently, bias
   voltage limit) in order to minimize inherent geometrical birefringence.
   This functionality optimizes Faraday rotation and thus enables the
   observation of subsequent magneto-optics.}},

Abstract = {{Optical systems that respect parity-time (PT) symmetry can be realized
   with proper incorporation of gain/loss materials. However, due to the
   absence of magnetic response at optical frequencies, the wave impedance
   is defined entirely by their permittivity and, hence, the PT-symmetric
   character is controlled solely via their refractive index. Here, we show
   that the separate tuning of the wave impedance enabled by metamaterials
   can grant access to wide control of the exceptional points, appearance
   of mixed phases (coexistence of PT-symmetric and PT-broken phases) and
   occurrence of phase reentries, not easily realizable with natural

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{52}},

Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{The measurement of single-pass chiral optical rotation and circular
   dichroism are the most widely used methods for chirality sensing, and
   are of fundamental importance to many fields in physics, chemistry and
   biology. The optical rotation method is also one of two successful
   methods for the measurement of atomic parity nonconservation (PNC), for
   low-energy tests of the electroweak sector of the standard model.
   However, PNC optical rotation signals are typically very weak, having
   been measured only in the most favourable cases of Tl, Bi, and Pb, and
   their measurement is limited by larger time-dependent backgrounds (such
   as spurious birefringence) and by imperfect and slow subtraction
   procedures. Using a novel bowtie cavity with an intracavity Faraday
   Effect, we have demonstrated three important improvements: (a) the
   enhancement of the chiral optical rotation angle by the number of the
   cavity passes (typically approximate to 1000); (b) the suppression of
   birefringent backgrounds; and (c) the ability to reverse the sign of the
   chiral optical rotation signal rapidly, allowing the isolation of the
   PNC signals from backgrounds. We discuss how these cavity-based
   improvements may allow the extension of the measurement of PNC optical
   rotation to atomic and molecular systems that would otherwise be
   inaccessible, for example to Cs and Dy atoms in magneto-optical traps,
   and to HgH molecules in jet expansions. For these cases, we show that
   potentially large PNC signals are possible, and we discuss the potential
   measurement of nuclear-spin-independent, nuclear-spin-dependent, and
   isotope-dependent PNC effects.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We present a design for producing precisely adjustable and alternating
   single-axis magnetic fields based on nested Halbach dipole pairs
   consisting of permanent magnets only. Our design allows for three
   dimensional optical and mechanical access to a region with strong
   adjustable dipolar fields, is compatible with systems operating under
   vacuum, and does not effectively dissipate heat under normal operational
   conditions. We present a theoretical analysis of the properties and
   capabilities of our design and construct a proof-of-concept prototype.
   Using our prototype, we demonstrate fields of up to several kilogauss
   with field homogeneities of better than 5\%, which are harmonically
   modulated at frequencies of similar to 1 Hz with a power consumption of
   approximately 1.2 W. Moreover, we discuss how our design can be modified
   to generate adjustable quadrupolar magnetic fields with gradients as
   large as 95 kG/m in a region of optical and mechanical access. Our
   design is scalable and can be constructed to be suitable not only for
   table-top experiments, as in the case of polarimetric and magnetometric
   setups that require strong alternating magnetic fields, but also for
   large scale applications such as generators. (C) 2019 Author(s).}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{An invisibility cloak should completely hide an object from an observer,
   ideally across the visible spectrum and for all angles of incidence and
   polarizations of light, in three dimensions. However, until now, all
   such devices have been limited to either small bandwidths or have
   disregarded the phase of the impinging wave or worked only along
   specific directions. Here, we show that these seemingly fundamental
   restrictions can be lifted by using cloaks made of fast-light media,
   termed tachyonic cloaks, where the wave group velocity is larger than
   the speed of light in vacuum. On the basis of exact analytic
   calculations and full-wave causal simulations, we demonstrate
   three-dimensional cloaking that cannot be detected even
   interferometrically across the entire visible regime. Our results open
   the road for ultrabroadband invisibility of large objects, with direct
   implications for stealth and information technology, non-disturbing
   sensors, near-field scanning optical microscopy imaging, and
   superluminal propagation.}},

Title = {{Sensitive detection of HO2 radicals produced in an atmospheric pressure
   plasma using Faraday rotation cavity ring-down spectroscopy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{151}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) is a well-established, highly
   sensitive absorption technique whose sensitivity and selectivity for
   trace radical sensing can be further enhanced by measuring the
   polarization rotation of the intracavity light by the paramagnetic
   samples in the presence of a magnetic field. In this paper, we highlight
   the use of this Faraday rotation cavity ring-down spectroscopy (FR-CRDS)
   for the detection of HO2 radicals. In particular, we use a cold
   atmospheric pressure plasma jet as a highly efficient source of HO2
   radicals and show that FR-CRDS in the near-infrared spectral region
   (1506 nm) has the potential to be a useful tool for studying radical
   chemistry. By simultaneously measuring ring-down times of orthogonal
   linearly polarized light, measurements of Faraday effect-induced
   rotation angles (theta) and absorption coefficients (alpha) are
   retrieved from the same data set. The Faraday rotation measurement
   exhibits better long-term stability and enhanced sensitivity due to its
   differential nature, whereby highly correlated noise between the two
   channels and slow drifts cancel out. The bandwidth-normalized
   sensitivities are alpha min=2.2x10-11 cm-1 Hz-1/2 and theta min=0.62
   nrad Hz-1/2. The latter corresponds to a minimum detectable (circular)
   birefringence of Delta nmin=5x10-16 Hz-1/2. Using the overlapping
   (q)Q(3)(N = 4-9) transitions of HO2, we estimate limits of detection of
   3.1 x 10(8) cm(-3) based on traditional (absorption) CRDS methods and
   6.7 x 10(7) cm(-3) using FR-CRDS detection, where each point of the
   spectrum was acquired during 2 s. In addition, Verdet constants for
   pertinent carrier (He, Ar) and bulk (N-2, O-2) gases were recorded in
   this spectral region for the first time. These show good agreement with
   recent measurements of air and values extrapolated from reported Verdet
   constants at shorter wavelengths, demonstrating the potential of FR-CRDS
   for measurements of very weak Faraday effects and providing a
   quantitative validation to the computed rotation angles. Published under

Abstract = {{Detection and differentiation of enantiomers in small quantities are
   crucially important in many scientific fields, including biology,
   chemistry, and pharmacy. Chiral molecules manifest their handedness in
   their interaction with the chiral state of light (e.g., circularly
   polarized light), which is commonly leveraged in circular dichroism (CD)
   spectroscopy. However, compared to the linear refractive index molecular
   chirality is extremely weak, resulting in low detection efficiencies.
   Recently, it has been shown that these weak chiroptical signals can be
   enhanced by increasing the optical chirality of the electromagnetic
   fields interacting with chiral samples. Here, we show numerically and
   analytically that dielectric structures can provide an optimum chiral
   sensing platform by offering uniform superchiral near-fields. To
   illustrate this, we first study a simple dielectric dimer and show that
   circularly polarized light can induce parallel and out of phase electric
   and magnetic fields, which are spectrally and spatially overlapped, and
   therefore produce superchiral fields at the midpoint of the dimer. This
   behavior is in contrast to, for example, a plasmonic dimer, where the
   optical chirality is limited by the electric dipolar field, which is not
   completely out of phase with the incident magnetic field. With the
   insights gained from this analysis, next we develop an approach for
   overlapping electric and magnetic fields in a single particle, based on
   Kerker effect. In particular, we introduce a Kerker-inspired metasurface
   consisting of holey dielectric disks, which offers uniform and
   accessible superchiral near-fields with CD signal enhancements of nearly
   24 times.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral sensitive techniques have been used to probe the fundamental
   symmetries of the universe, study biomolecular structures, and even
   develop safe drugs. As chiral signals are inherently weak and often
   suppressed by large backgrounds, different techniques have been proposed
   to overcome the limitations of traditionally used chiral polarimetry.
   Here, we propose an angle-resolved chiral surface plasmon resonance
   (CHISPR) scheme that can detect the absolute chirality (handedness and
   magnitude) of a chiral sample and is sensitive to both the real and the
   imaginary part of a chiral sample's refractive index. We present
   analytical results and numerical simulations of CHISPR measurements,
   predicting signals at visible wavelengths. Moreover, we present a
   theoretical analysis that clarifies how our far-field measurements
   elucidate the underlying physics. This CHISPR protocol does not require
   elaborate fabrication and has the advantage of being directly
   implementable on existing surface plasmon resonance instrumentation.}},

Abstract = {{Metasurfaces based on resonant subwavelength photonic structures enable
   novel ways of wavefront control and light focusing, underpinning a new
   generation of flat-optics devices(1). Recently emerged all-dielectric
   asymmetric metasurfaces, composed of arrays of metaunits with broken
   inplane inversion symmetry(2-7), exhibit high-quality resonances
   originating from the intriguing physics of bound states in the
   continuum. Here, we combine dielectric metasurfaces and hyperspectral
   imaging to develop an ultrasensitive label-free analytical platform for
   biosensing. Our technique can acquire spatially resolved spectra from
   millions of image pixels and use smart data-processing tools to extract
   high-throughput digital sensing information at the unprecedented level
   of less than three molecules per mu m(2). We further show spectral data
   retrieval from a single image without using spectrometers, enabled by
   our unique sensor design, paving the way for portable diagnostic
   applications. This combination of nanophotonics and imaging optics
   extends the capabilities of dielectric metasurfaces to analyse

Month = {{MAY 28}},
Abstract = {{Optical systems with gain and loss that respect parity-time (PT)
   symmetry can have real eigenvalues despite their non-Hermitian
   character. Chiral systems impose circularly polarized waves which do not
   preserve their handedness under the combined space- and time-reversal
   operations and, as a result, seem to be incompatible with systems
   possessing PT symmetry. Nevertheless, in this work we show that in
   certain configurations, PT symmetric permittivity, permeability, and
   chirality is possible; in addition, real eigenvalues are maintained even
   if the chirality goes well beyond PT symmetry. By obtaining all three
   constitutive parameters in realistic chiral metamaterials through
   simulations and retrieval, we show that the chirality can be tailored
   independently of permittivity and permeability; thus, in such systems, a
   wide control of new optical properties including advanced polarization
   control is achieved.}},

Abstract = {{To track unknown sources and sinks of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
   inside forest canopies we measured did cycles of VOC exchanges in a
   temperate maritime forest at the branch, stem and ground level with
   special focus on the chiral signatures of pinenes. All compartments
   released day and night alpha- and beta-pinene as major compounds. In
   addition, strong light dependent emissions of ocimene and linalool from
   branches occurred during hot summer days. In all compartments the
   overall emission strength of pinenes varied from day to day spanning 1
   to 2 orders of magnitude. The highest pinene emissions from ground and
   stem were observed during high moisture conditions. Despite this
   variability stem emissions consistently expressed a different chiral
   composition than branch emissions, the former containing a much larger
   fraction of (-)-enantiomers than the latter. Pinene emissions from dead
   needle litter and soil were mostly enriched in (-)-enantiomers, while
   the chiral signatures of the ambient air inside the forest showed mostly
   intermediate levels compared to the emission signatures. These findings
   suggest that different organ-specific pinene producing enzymes exist in
   Maritime pine, and indicate that emissions from ground and stem
   compartments essentially contribute to the canopy VOC flux. Overall the
   results open new perspectives to explore chirality as a possible marker
   to recognize shifts in the contributions of different VOC sources
   present within forest ecosystems and to explain observed temporal
   changes in the chiral signature of pinenes in the atmosphere. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Infrared spectroscopy is widely used for biomolecular studies, but
   struggles when investigating minute quantities of analytes due to the
   mismatch between vibrational cross sections and IR wavelengths. It is
   therefore beneficial to enhance absorption signals by confining the
   infrared light to deeply subwavelength volumes comparable in size to the
   biomolecules of interest. This can be achieved with surface enhanced
   infrared absorption spectroscopy, for which plasmonic nanorod antennas
   represent the predominant implementation. However, unifying design
   guidelines for such systems are still lacking. Here, we introduce an
   experimentally verified framework for designing antenna-based molecular
   IR spectroscopy sensors. Specifically, we find that in order to maximize
   the sensing performance, it is essential to combine the signal
   enhancement originating from nanoscale gaps between the antenna elements
   with the enhancement obtained from coupling, to the grating order modes
   of the unit cell. Using an optimized grating order-coupled nanogap
   design, our experiments and numerical simulations show a hotspot limit
   of detection of two proteins per nanogap. Furthermore, we introduce and
   analyze additional limit of detection parameters, specifically for
   deposited surface mass, in-solution concentration, and secondary
   structure determination. These limits of detection provide valuable
   reference points for performance metrics of surface-enhanced infrared
   absorption spectroscopy in practical applications, such as the
   characterization of biological samples in aqueous solution.}},

Abstract = {{Optical resonators can enhance light-matter interaction, modify
   intrinsic molecular properties such as radiative emission rates, and
   create new molecule-photon hybrid quantum states. To date, corresponding
   implementations are based on electronic transitions in the visible
   spectral region with large transition dipoles yet hampered by fast
   femtosecond electronic dephasing. In contrast, coupling molecular
   vibrations with their weaker dipoles to infrared optical resonators has
   been less explored, despite long-lived coherences with 2 orders of
   magnitude longer dephasing times. Here, we achieve excitation of
   molecular vibrations through configurable optical interactions of a
   nanotip with an infrared resonant nanowire that supports tunable bright
   and nonradiative dark modes. The resulting antenna-vibrational coupling
   up to 47 +/- 5 cm(-1) exceeds the intrinsic dephasing rate of the
   molecular vibration, leading to hybridization and mode splitting. We
   observe nanotip-induced quantum interference of vibrational excitation
   pathways in spectroscopic nanoimaging, which we model classically as
   plasmonic electromagnetically induced scattering as the phase-controlled
   extension of the classical analogue of electromagnetically induced
   transparency and absorption. Our results present a new regime of IR
   spectroscopy for applications of vibrational coherence from quantum
   computing to optical control of chemical reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Electron interactions with the nuclear-spin-dependent (NSD)
   parity-nonconserving (PNC) anapole moment are strongly enhanced within
   heteronuclear diatomic molecules. A low-energy optical rotation
   experiment is being proposed with the aim of observing NSD PNC
   interactions in HgH. Based on the relativistic coupled cluster method we
   present a sophisticated numerical calculation of the circular
   polarization parameter P = 2 Im(E1(P)(Nc))/M1 approximate to 3 x 10(-6
   )kappa for the (2)Sigma(1)(/2) -> (2)pi(1/2) optical transition of HgH,
   where K is a dimensionless constant determined by the nuclear anapole
   moment. This provides an improvement in sensitivity to NSD PNC by 2-3
   orders of magnitude over the leading atomic Xe, Hg, Tl, Pb, and Bi
   optical rotation experiments. Therefore we show that the proposed
   measurement should be sensitive enough to extract the 199 Hg anapole
   moment and shed light on the underlying theory of hadronic parity
   violation.}},

Abstract = {{Chirality plays an essential role in life, providing unique
   functionalities to a wide range of biomolecules, chemicals, and drugs,
   which makes chiral sensing and analysis critically important. The wider
   application of chiral sensing continues to be constrained by the
   involved chiral signals being inherently weak. To remedy this, plasmonic
   and dielectric nanostructures have recently been shown to offer a viable
   route for enhancing weak circular dichroism (CD) effects, but most
   relevant studies have thus far been ad hoc, not guided by a rigorous
   analytical methodology. Here, we report the first analytical treatment
   of CD enhancement and extraction from a chiral biolayer placed on top of
   a nanostructured substrate. We derive closed-form expressions of the CD
   and its functional dependence on the background-chiroptical response,
   substrate thickness and chirality, as well as on the optical chirality
   and intensity enhancement provided by the structure. Our results provide
   key insights into the trade-offs that are to be accommodated in the
   design and conception of optimal nanophotonic structures for enhancing
   CD effects for chiral molecule detection. Based on our analysis, we also
   introduce a practical, dielectric platform for chiral sensing featuring
   large CD enhancements while exhibiting vanishing chiroptical background
   noise.}},

Abstract = {{Metasurfaces provide opportunities for wavefront control, flat optics,

   analysis of surface-bound analytes. Our technique features a
   two-dimensional pixelated dielectric metasurface with a range of
   ultrasharp resonances, each tuned to a discrete frequency; this enables
   molecular absorption signatures to be read out at multiple spectral
   points, and the resulting information is then translated into a
   barcode-like spatial absorption map for imaging. The signatures of
   biological, polymer, and pesticide molecules can be detected with high
   sensitivity, covering applications such as biosensing and environmental
   monitoring. Our chemically specific technique can resolve absorption
   fingerprints without the need for spectrometry, frequency scanning, or
   moving mechanical parts, thereby paving the way toward sensitive and
   versatile miniaturized mid infrared spectroscopy devices.}},

Abstract = {{A multitude of biological processes are enabled by complex interactions
   between lipid membranes and proteins. To understand such dynamic
   processes, it is crucial to differentiate the constituent biomolecular
   species and track their individual time evolution without invasive
   labels. Here, we present a label-free mid-infrared biosensor capable of
   distinguishing multiple analytes in heterogeneous biological samples
   with high sensitivity. Our technology leverages a multi-resonant
   metasurface to simultaneously enhance the different vibrational
   fingerprints of multiple biomolecules. By providing up to 1000-fold
   near-field intensity enhancement over both amide and methylene bands,
   our sensor resolves the interactions of lipid membranes with different
   polypeptides in real time. Significantly, we demonstrate that our
   label-free chemically specific sensor can analyze peptide-induced
   neurotransmitter cargo release from synaptic vesicle mimics. Our sensor
   opens up exciting possibilities for gaining new insights into biological
   processes such as signaling or transport in basic research as well as
   provides a valuable toolkit for bioanalytical and pharmaceutical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic detection of protein conformational changes at physiological
   conditions on a minute amount of samples is immensely important for
   understanding the structural determinants of protein function in health
   and disease and to develop assays and diagnostics for protein misfolding
   and protein aggregation diseases. Herein, we experimentally demonstrate
   the capabilities of a mid-infrared plasmonic biosensor for real-time and
   in situ protein secondary structure analysis in aqueous environment at
   nanoscale. We present label-free ultrasensitive dynamic monitoring of
   beta-sheet to disordered conformational transitions in a monolayer of
   the disease-related alpha-synuclein protein under varying stimulus
   conditions. Our experiments show that the extracted secondary structure
   signals from plasmonically enhanced amide I signatures in the protein
   monolayer can be reliably and reproducibly acquired with second
   derivative analysis for dynamic monitoring. Furthermore, by using a
   polymer layer we show that our nanoplasmonic approach of extracting the
   frequency components of vibrational signatures matches with the results
   attained from gold-standard infrared transmission measurements. By
   facilitating conformational analysis on small quantities of immobilized
   proteins in response to external stimuli such as drugs, our plasmonic
   biosensor could be used to introduce platforms for screening small
   molecule modulators of protein misfolding and aggregation.}},

Abstract = {{Plasmonic nanoantennas offer new applications in mid-infrared (mid-IR)
   absorption spectroscopy with ultrasensitive detection of structural
   signatures of biomolecules, such as proteins, due to their strong
   resonant near-fields. The amide I fingerprint of a protein contains
   conformational information that is greatly important for understanding
   its function in health and disease. Here, we introduce a non-invasive,
   label-free mid-IR nanoantenna-array sensor for secondary structure
   identification of nanometer-thin protein layers in aqueous solution by
   resolving the content of plasmonically enhanced amide I signatures. We
   successfully detect random coil to cross beta-sheet conformational
   changes associated with a-synuclein protein aggregation, a detrimental
   process in many neurodegenerative disorders. Notably, our experimental
   results demonstrate high conformational sensitivity by differentiating
   subtle secondary-structural variations in a native beta-sheet protein
   monolayer from those of cross beta-sheets, which are characteristic of
   pathological aggregates. Our nanoplasmonic biosensor is a highly
   promising and versatile tool for in vitro structural analysis of thin
   protein layers.}},

Title = {{Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in
   physics and engineering}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},

Pages = {{1260-1264}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of
   system, having bandwidth Delta omega, can interact with a wave over only
   a constrained time period Delta t inversely proportional to the
   bandwidth (Delta t-Delta w similar to 2 pi). This law severely limits
   the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding
   systems in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics,
   acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is
   thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier
   reciprocity. We propose that this ``fundamental{''} limit can be
   overcome in systems where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a system
   becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which
   the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we
   theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized
   semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders
   of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise
   prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant systems,
   challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be
   narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with
   unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.}},
